# Gender Recognition
This is a prject built in C++ using QT to detect faces and then genders from a camera stream.
It then displays an advert based on the most common gender over a user set amount of time.

Given a set of faces it uses eigen vectors to create a cascade file after it finished learning between male and female faces. Thre are some of the cascade sheets included.
The faces I had to source seperately and then sort manually into female and male.
